
# G2A REFUND EXPLOIT

Tampermonkey script that's used to modify the g2a bitcoin address to the scammer's bitcoin address.

## Logic

1. **Stage 1** is executed, which loads stage2 (g2aexp1, interval) and stage3.

2. **g2aexp1** modifies the first entry in the payments to become bitcoin.

3. **interval** used to hide the "Don't change the bitcoin wallet address.." warning message that g2a shows.

4. **Stage 3** replaces the orginal pay button with an fake button that when clicked shows an identical overlay that g2a shows expect the bitcoin address is different.
